cross validation
use Stacked Cross-Validation for testing appropriate data length
power curve
wind speed ^3
remove features that are correlated, pca?
sensitivity analysis: prediction length, number of features, 
more metrics in plots
outlier detection, maybe too aggressive


questions:
power curve, above maximum value, output 0?
first column is wind speed at what height?
