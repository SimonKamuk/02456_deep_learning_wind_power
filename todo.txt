cross validation
use Stacked Cross-Validation for testing appropriate data length
remove features that are correlated or pca?
sensitivity analysis: prediction length, number of features, 
more metrics in plots
outlier detection, maybe too aggressive



questions:
is it reasonable
rnn slow
conv before or after rnn

hints for nn architecture

mae loss
use all cases
